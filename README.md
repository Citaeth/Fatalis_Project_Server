The server side of the Fatalis Project.
In this part, you can find mainly the code to deal with the server request.
For this server, I use a machine, where I installed a Linux Debian OS, and create a server using Caddy Server service. 
I deal with the content of the server using a PosteGreSQL DataBase system, and the request are dealt by flaskApp.
I made the IP usable from every location, using DuckDNS.org. 

The goal was to have a machine/storage that only us have physically acces, and that we can manage as we want. 
During the first step of the process, I had in mind to used some more commun drive way, as Google Drive, and used the API to create my Client side UI. 
But after few time of development, I gives up against the lot of "Only 30$/month for this service!", And I decide to put this 30$ to buy a machine and a coffee for the time where I'll create everything from scratch. 

It allow me to become really familiar with Linux Environment, using more deeply database or request, and understand better how to work with a network.

If you want to know more about the client side of this project, which is represent really different aspect of what I learn in python (sadly all the maya MEL/python/OpenMaya... is missing, but soon, soon..), you can find it in the Client Repo.
